# Mods

## I can't join the server, says something about keys.

You ran the game with wrong mods. Best download the modlist again, load it up in the launcher, and boot the game with proper modlist again.

## I get kicked out of the server due to some *.pbo verification.

## I can't download Arma mods, I get "No downloaded files" error or something.

Delete everything from `temp` and `downloads` directories. You can find these in workshop folder, on the same drive where your Arma instance is installed. E.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop`.
